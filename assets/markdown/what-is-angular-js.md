# What is AngularJS?

AngularJS has been introduced by the giant, Google. It is a framework that helps you to create dynamic Web apps. Normally, AngularJS uses HTML as the backbone. AngularJS creates extended HTML tags that can be used as normal HTML tags. These tags will help you to write an efficient code. The interesting fact is that you can reduce the lines of code  you may need to write when you use normal JavaScript.

AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework developed by Google. It is a structural framework for dynamic Web apps. It is easy to update and get information from your HTML document. It helps in writing a proper maintainable architecture, that can be tested at a client side code.
- This framework is developed on MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
- It provides full featured SPA (Single Page Application) framework.
- It supports Dependency Injection.
- It supports two-way data binding.
- It provides routing features.
- Testing was designed right from the beginning; so you can build robust tests.
- For DOM manipulation, jqLite is built-in; which is kind of like the Mini-Me of jQuery.
- Separation of the client side of an Application from the Server side.
- The AngularJS framework uses Plain Old JavaScript Objects(POJO), it doesnâ€™t need the getter or setter functions.
